  Capital Framework is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns by the
  [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/) with the
  following goals:
  consolidate front-end code patterns across CFPB web products in a
  [collaborative way](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/components/#an-introduction-to-the-component-methodology),
  adhere to design and UX standards set forth by the
  [CFPB Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/),
  respect the guiding principles of accessibility,
  and support a wide range of browsers, even down to IE7.

  As a work of the United States Government, all code is open source and in the
  public domain (excluding any exceptions listed within a Capital Framework
  component's TERMS).
  We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute
  back.
