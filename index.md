## Defining features:

- Components are broken into distinct [modular repositories]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/#an-introduction-to-the-component-methodology).
- Coding meets accessibility standards.
- Built to support Internet Explorer down to version 7.


## Test drive

You can quickly grab componenets through the command line with Bower:

~~~
$ bower install git://github.com/cfpb/cf-grid.git
~~~
{: .highlight }

Once downloaded you can import the Capital Framework source files that you need:

{% highlight css %}
@import "bower_components/cf-grid/src/cf-grid.less";

// Set up a wrapper for your page using the grid_wrapper mixin from cf-grid.
.my-page-wrapper {
    .grid_wrapper();
}

// Set up some structural elements using the grid_column mixin from cf-grid.
.my-main-content {
    .grid_column(8);
}
.my-sidebar {
    .grid_column(4);
}
{% endhighlight %}
{: .highlight }

That's it! You've just set up a simple two column layout.
